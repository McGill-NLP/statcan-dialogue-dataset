# Project website

This is a project website for Statcan Dialogue Dataset.

## Getting started

You can follow one of the following ways to get started.

## Activate GitHub Pages

Once the template is copied to your project, you need to activate GitHub Pages for your project.

1. Click on the "Settings" button in the top right corner of the page.
2. Click on the "Pages" tab.
3. In "Source", select branch to be "main" and folder to "/docs".
4. Click on "Save"
5. Go to the "Actions" tab (on the right of "Pull requests" tab) and wait for the action to finish.
6. Visit your project page at mcgill-nlp.github.io/<your-project-name>


### Why `docs/`?

You might be wondering why all the files for the webpage is in `/docs`. Well the page is not really "docs" per se, it's because `github-pages` only allows us to either use the root folder or `/docs`. So we are forced to use the latter in order to clearly separate this page from the rest of the project. Maybe in the future GitHub will allow other names like `/page`, but before then there's nothing we can do... 

But what if you actually want to write some docs for your library? You can just edit `docs/_pages/docs.md`, which is the real page for documentations.
  

## Navigation bar

You can already find links to different pages in the navigation bar. To add, remove, or modify links, you can edit [`docs/_data/navigation.yml`](docs/_data/navigation.yml) file. The `title` corresponds to the text that appear on the navbar, and the `url` corresponds to the relative URL of the page. It is not recommended to include an external URL, as that should be in `/home` page.

## Modifying a page

The files are located in [`docs/_pages/`](docs/_pages/). For example, if you want to modify the `/home` page, you would edit `docs/_pages/home.md`.

All of the pages are markdown files with something called a [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) at the top, which uses the YAML syntax. Generally, all you need to worry about is the title and the permalink (the latter is the relative URL of the page). In the case of `/home`, you also need to specify external links (`header.actions`) and author names (`excerpt`). However, a template is already provided for you, you only need to modify the content.

## Adding and removing pages

To add a page:
1. Create a new file in `docs/_pages/`, with the desired `permalink` to be your relative URL. So for example, `/contact/` links to `mcgill-nlp.github.io/my-project/contact`.
2. In `docs/_data/navigation.yml`, add a new entry with the `title` and `url` from the previous step.

To remove a page:
1. Delete the file in `docs/_pages/`.
2. In `docs/_data/navigation.yml`, remove the entry with the same `url` as the deleted file.


## Documentations and API for your project

Note that there's a tab that says `docs`, and you can see that it links to other pages. So this is a standalone doc page inside your webpage. Note also that, due to Github pages' caveat, we were forced to put the webpage in `/docs`, but the actual docs are in `/docs/_docs`. Now that's cleared up, you can head to [`/docs/_docs/README.md`](/docs/_docs/README.md) to read the instructions.

> Do you feel writing documentation is too complicated or time-consuming, and you'd like something more straightforward? Check out the [template for using MkDocs](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mkdocs-template) instead. However, the simplicity comes at the cost of more repositories and different frameworks to maintain.

## Advanced

For any advanced modification, it is recommended to look in the advanced section of the readme of the [group website](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io). Below are a extra tips included for convenience.

### Setup

Please refer to setup instructions in the readme of the [group website](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/mcgill-nlp.github.io).

### Running locally

```bash
cd docs/
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Removing dark mode

To remove dark mode, inside [`docs/_config.yml`](docs/_config.yml) file, remove `dark_theme_css`. The dark mode should automatically turn off.

### Updating footer

Inside [`docs/_config.yml`](docs/_config.yml) file, you can modify the footer.

### Modify `excerpt` in a splash page (`/home`)

If you want to modify the excerpt in the `/home` page, you can do so in [`docs/_sass_/splash.scss`](docs/_sass_/splash.scss). Note that `splash.scss` was added specifically for this template, not for the group website.

### Modify or remove icons in splash page buttons

This is handled in [`docs/_includes/page__hero.html`](docs/_includes/page__hero.html). That file was added specifically for this template, not for the group website. You can modify that file to add, modify or remove icons.
